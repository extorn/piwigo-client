This is an amazing project to allow manipulation of a PIWIGO server from an android device

Please note:

This project has been an ever evolving work in progress
It does NOT use best practices. I've been learning as I go along.
By all means use access to this code to understand how things work, but please don't make the mistake of cloning this project architecture.

All rights are reserved.
Though all source code is publicly visible, this does not mean it can be cloned and forked etc. I really wouldn't recommend it in any case.

If you're interested in Android development, there are elements within this project that may be interesting, but if you're totally new to Android development, equally there are a lot of things about this project that will lead you astray, so develop a few small apps using current best practices as dictated on the google android developer pages so you can view this code without confusing yourself.

I hope some elements of this code are useful.
I've not seen examples of video compression that work by hooking custom renderers in to the exoplayer library, so maybe that is of interest to someone.
