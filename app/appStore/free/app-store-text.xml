Upcoming Changes:

The intention is to enhance the user interface progressively, and one of the users, David Klement, has kindly provided some suggestions for screen layouts going forward which I have started using from version 1.3.95 and will no doubt be taking more ideas from. The proposals are available in full:

Known limitations:

1. Comments are currently unsupported - you can neither see comments nor add them. If this missing feature is important to you - please talk to me.
2. The number of files that can be added to an upload job is limited to 5 in this free version (use the paid version to remove this limit)
