            - App crashes (that you choose to report) are the ONLY way I know there is a problem unless you email me.
            I will add an error handler to remind users of this. It sounds counter intuitive, but its sometimes best
            that I let the app crash because users almost always don't tell me when something doesn't work!

            Bugfix:

            - Prevented requests resulting in SSL Handshake error automatically retrying.
            - Ensured md5sum is treated as optional when retrieving resource information
            Warning:
            - I have noted that an assumption is made that the server is using md5sums for uniqueness tests. Be aware of this if you use the upload feature. This is existing functionality, nothing new."
