    <string name="about_content">"This app was written to allow me easier access to my Piwigo photo gallery while on the move.

Sourcecode: https://github.com/extorn/piwigo-client

No further updates are planned for this app, thank you for you support if you have purchased a copy. Without paid users I would have stopped development on this app a long time ago.
I am currently working through bugs as they crop up and releasing them, sometimes new features get added.
Essentially, the app works, and what it does to the server it does correctly, but, my lack of Android development experience shows and it does crash sometimes.

If you're able to establish a set of steps that always cause a crash, please drop me an email or raise an issue on my github project page to assist me in fixing it.

In August 2018, a user, David Klement, came back to me with screen mock-ups for a more professional design. Starting with release 1.3.95, I have been incorporating those ideas, starting with the album view screen.
These full list of proposed screen designs are available to view on the app website (https://api-8938561204297001672-604498.firebaseapp.com/design-proposals/index.html).

NOTE: Language translations are performed using www.Deepl.com or google translate websites. If you spot any obvious errors, please let me know so I can correct them.

There are two versions, a free version (with advertisements) and a paid version (free of advertisements). You are free to choose which you prefer. You cannot 'upgrade' the free version at present, install the paid version, and delete the free version.
Note: The versions will diverge over time. Most changes will be made to both free and paid versions.

Presently, the paid version has added support for tags:
        Piwigo supports tags to a degree out of the box, but the User Tags plugin adds more features (basic testing performed).
        If there is a feature with regards tags that you want but the app doesn't provide, please ask.

At the moment, it provides a basic level of functionality to allow navigation around an existing gallery, upload of new photos and videos, and creating new categories within a gallery. Some fields can be amended once created, but many are still read only.... for now!

Please can I ask that if you uninstall the app, you use the link on the app menu to email me telling me why the app did not meet your needs so I can address this.

The version of the PIWIGO server I test against is currently 11.0.3.

My test gallery contains .jpg and .mp4 and .m4v files only. If yours contains others, you may well encounter problems - if so, please tell me and I'll prioritise work on those file types.

I have been testing with a copy of the piwigo_privacy plugin installed and also the VideoJS plugin installed.
* Note: I have had to request some changes to the privacy plugin for some recent changes. If you're having issues with this plugin, I might well be able to help (this plugin is not my work though).

I have a copy of the Extended Description plugin installed, and have added support for some of the features it supplies, but it will require that you install my plugin on your server - PiwigoClientWsExts.

Please report any drop me an email if you encounter any bugs. I\'ve tested this on the android emulator, a Samsung phone and a Samsung tablet, but it\'s my first app so I\'m sure things will go wrong for someone.

A big thank you to everyone who has emailed me with suggestions or bugs. I will endeavor to address all of your suggestions as soon as practical.

Please do choose to report every crash that occurs. If you find the bug still occurs after the next update, please take the time to email me. It's likely I need a little bit more context around what is happening just before the bug occurs.

Releases are on an ad-hoc basis at the moment. The frequency of releases is expected to reduce as the app matures. The release schedule and history is shown below. This may change and things may get delayed, but you can see what's on the list."</string>

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
