    <string name="about_content">"This app was written to allow me easier access to my photo gallery while on the move.

It will be updated regularly to add more features.

There are two versions, a free version (with advertisements) and a paid version (free of advertisements). You are free to choose which you prefer. You cannot 'upgrade' the free version at present, install the paid version, and delete the free version.
Note: There is currently no difference between the versions, and the intention is to keep the versions in-sync. What this means is that the same changes will be made to both free and paid versions. However, the free version is likely to be a release or two ahead of the paid one, making the paid one more stable.

At the moment, it provides a basic level of functionality to allow navigation around an existing gallery, upload of new photos and videos, and creating new categories within a gallery. Some fields can be amended once created, but many are still read only.... for now!

Please can I ask that if you uninstall the app, you use the link on the app menu to email me telling me why the app did not meet your needs so I can address this.

The version of the PIWIGO server I test against is currently 2.9.2.

My test gallery contains .jpg and .mp4 files only. If yours contains others, you may well encounter problems - if so, please tell me and I'll prioritise work on those file types.

WARNING: Versions of Piwigo below 1.9.2 - upload of videos is I think dependent on fix #756 being applied to your server.

I have been testing with a copy of the piwigo_privacy plugin installed and also the VideoJS plugin installed.
I have a copy of the Extended Description plugin installed, but unfortunately, this functionality is not yet exposed via the PIWIGO API.
I\'d like to include support for "favorite" photos but this functionality does not yet appear to be exposed via the PIWIGO API.

Please report any drop me an email if you encounter any bugs. I\'ve tested this on the android emulator, a Samsung phone and a Samsung tablet, but it\'s my first app so I\'m sure things will go wrong for someone.

A big thank you to everyone who has emailed me with suggestions or bugs. I will endeavor to address all of your suggestions as soon as practical.

Please do choose to report every crash that occurs. If you find the bug still occurs after the next update, please take the time to email me. It's likely I need a little bit more context around what is happening just before the bug occurs.

Releases are on an ad-hoc basis at the moment. The frequency of releases is expected to reduce as the app matures. The release schedule and history is shown below. This may change and things may get delayed, but you can see what's on the list.


Planned releases:

Release 1.3.x - Changes:
                    - ? German, French, other translations for the app ?

Release 1.3.75 - Changes:
                    - User interface refinements
                    - Poll a device folder and automatically upload any content found to a specified Piwigo profile
                    - Support for favorites - depends on PIWIGO API enhancement
                    - Possibly - Notify user of server updates that are available
                    - ? Please email me (there is an email link in the navigation bar) to request things you need or want that this app doesn't yet do

Release 1.3.74 - Changes:
                    - Possibly - The ability to delete an album, but not its contents (creating orphans)
                    - Possibly - Orphan file management
                    - Possibly - Support for user comments
                    - Possibly - allow linking the upload process to a compression routine for videos
                    - Rework of the way popup messages and progress indicators are shown so they always appear.
                    - Tidy the error messages during the upload process
                    - Further investigation into memory use

Released:

Release 1.3.73 - Bugfix:
                    - Limit state recording of slideshow pages to 5 pages to prevent crashes

Release 1.3.72 - Changes:
                    - Altered colours (likely to continue changing for a while)
                    - Rounded corners of albums (Android version >= Lollipop)
               - Bugfix:
                    - More reuse of images loaded and better management of those loaded to reduce memory load

Release 1.3.71 - Bugfix:
                    - Removed 3 bugs causing crashes that are probably linked to the app being placed in the background.
                    - Ensure that if an upload job fails for some reason, that it is possible to clear that job without reinstalling the app. Note: Not tested
                    - Files shared with the app for upload fail to appear in the upload list

Release 1.3.70 - Changes:
                    - Keystore loading tested - password protected keystores may now be loaded (BKS and PKCS12 format only). No JKS after all, sorry.
                    - Check for and remove any calls to Thread.sleep
                    - memory use improvement for people using the share with feature
               - Bugfix:
                    - Crash expanding upload album dropdown on upload page before the albums have loaded

Release 1.3.69 - Notes:
                    - Noted people are trying to load password protected keys or from password protected pkcs files
                    - App crashes (that you choose to report) are the ONLY way I know there is a problem unless you email me.
                      I will add an error handler to remind users of this. It sounds counter intuitive, but its sometimes best
                      that I let the app crash because users almost always don't tell me when something doesn't work!
                    - Most crashes are caused by running out of memory - please help me diagnose this if it occurs to you
                 Bugfix:
                    - crash - Race condition after file upload complete
                    - crash - Upload job not found in upload intent (very odd)
                    - crash - shutdown picasso kinder
                 Changes:
                    - Added support for loading password protected pkcs files (untested)
                    - Added support for loading multiple certificates from certificate files (untested)
                    - Allowed loading of keys or certificates from JKS keystore files with a .jks filename suffix.

Release 1.3.68 - Bugfix:
                    - Changed event management to correct bug where files missing from upload page when shared with the app

Release 1.3.67 - Bugfix:
                    - Fixed bug allowing crash on resume of fragments where dialog is shown immediately  (e.g. upload)
                    - Prevent user trying to create new album prior to the parent album being selected
               - Attempted Bugfix (if this occurs for you, please email me saying how to reproduce this):
                    - Attempt to fix bug causing crash when using back button at an unknown point in the app (a guess)
                    - Attempt to fix bug on slideshow causing crash (a guess)

Release 1.3.66 - Changes:
                    - Updated to latest available library versions
                 Bugfix:
                    - Access to the user and group pages resulted in crash on older devices (no vector graphics support).

Release 1.3.65 - Changes:
                    - Added extra error handling around login and logout on the connection preferences page

Release 1.3.13 - Bugfix - For non admin users, album permissions are incorrectly displayed and load attempted - this fails as not authorised and displays a misleading error message in album.
                 Bugfix - For non admin users, album edit button is displayed.
                 Bugfix - Not all parent album content displayed is automatically refreshed on upload to a child album

Release 1.3.12 - Bugfix - crash caused by saving invalid piwigo server resourceUrl in the preferences

Release 1.3.11 - Added rough but theoretically complete support for client certificate authentication (UNTESTED - Please email me if this doesn't work - I'll prioritise completing it).
                   - supports importing of client certificate from .p12 and .cer files.
                 Bugfix - regression - where slideshow position is reset when screen is rotated
                 Bugfix - regression - permissions incorrectly shown for album items
                 Bugfix - regression - where slideshow shows occasional blank positions after deleting a number of items from it
                 Bugfix - slideshow not in sync with gallery contents after returning from an upload operation (warning now shown)
                 Bugfix - issue if deleting a slideshow item before server has had time to return the resource details (privacy details and rating).
                 Bugfix - Upload of file seems to randomly "fail" stating it's already been added to the server (HTTP 500 response received from server)


Release 1.3.10 - Bug fixes surrounding the new functionality of uploading by sharing images.
                 Bug fixes on issues that cause a crash if the app is minimised during Uploading

Release 1.3.9 - Hope to have fixed a bug caused when the app is left for long periods and the session is logged out. Please report the crashes still if this occurs again.

Release 1.3.8 - Bug fixes. (Mainly - Re-enabled Uploading of images)
                Added a share-to action so you can select a file or files for upload using other apps.

Release 1.3.7 - Added support for adding / editing groups and their permissions
                Fixed a number of bugs in or around the slideshow area of the app
                Fixed a bug preventing video playback on non standard http/https ports
                Further performance enhancements


Release 1.3.6 - Added support for adding / editing users and their permissions
                Added support for servers running schemes on non standard ports (e.g. https on port 80, or server running on port 81 etc)
                Added support to accept invalid SSL certificates if wanted (sometimes needed when using public wifi that intercepts https traffic)
                Prevent access to admin screens previously visited when the app is locked by using the back button

Release 1.3.5 - Caching of videos is not required to allow playback now
                Preferences now display correctly when returning to them using the back button.
                Corrected bugs in the use of back button generally
                Switched offset of image/album detail toggle button to be in dp (if you need px instead, please tell me)

Release 1.3.4 - Firstly, apologies, this release has been a long time coming but I wanted to be sure that I had only introduced improvements
                Reworked the PIWIGO API access to stop responses getting "lost" if the device is for example rotated while a request to the server is in progress
                Removed several bugs that would cause the app to crash.
                Changed file upload to allow uploading to continue in the background
                Added local caching of video files (configurable) and the ability to save fully cached videos locally if enabled.
                Removed image size download option for image sizes not explicitly generated on the server
                Corrected a bug in the slideshow displayed while deleting files
                Long click on album thumbnails and album resources invokes redownloading of that resource (On Videos, it clears any locally cached data)
                Fixed a number of bugs in the area of changing user sessions without restarting the app
                Clear the back button history when a user session is changed
                Added a gallery property to allow user correction of the positioning of the image / video details bottom drawer that slides up
                You can drill into users and groups and view album permissions in full screen to make this easier on a small screen

Release 1.3.3 - Fixed a bug that was reported by a user as causing an application crash (in Release 1.3.1)

Release 1.3.2 - Fixed a bug that was reported by a user as causing an application crash (in Release 1.3.1)
                Added ability to browse users and groups, view their permissions across a gallery, and delete them as wanted.

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
